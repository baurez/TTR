# Ticket To Ride 

I think I'm gonna be sad<br />
I think it's today, yeah<br />
The girl that's driving me mad<br />
Is going away<br />
<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
But she don't care<br />
<br />
She said that living with me<br />
Is bringing her down, yeah<br />
For she would never be free<br />
When I was around<br />
<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
But she don't care<br />
<br />
I don't know why she's riding so high<br />
She ought to think twice<br />
She ought to do right by me<br />
Before she gets to saying goodbye<br />
She ought to think twice<br />
She ought to do right by me<br />
<br />
I think I'm gonna be sad<br />
I think it's today, yeah<br />
The girl that's driving me mad<br />
Is going away, yeah<br />
<br />
Oh, she's got a ticket to ride<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
But she don't care<br />
<br />
I don't know why she's riding so high<br />
She ought to think twice<br />
She ought to do right by me<br />
Before she gets to saying goodbye<br />
She ought to think twice<br />
She ought to do right by me<br />
<br />
She said that living with me<br />
Is bringing her down, yeah<br />
For she would never be free<br />
When I was around<br />
<br />
Ah, she's got a ticket to ride<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
She's got a ticket to ride<br />
But she don't care<br />
<br />
My baby don't care, my baby don't care<br />
My baby don't care, my baby don't care<br />
My baby don't care, my baby don't care (fade out)<br />
